<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many languages don’t have the sound </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Just by looking at it, you would think it’s a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a silent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">h</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the sound is a soft, slightly aspirated </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sound with the tongue touching the lower part of the upper front teeth. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially Germans get a lot of laughs from native speakers for their lacking of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It sounds more like a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">z</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s why they are often called tongue in cheek </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zee Germans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to exercise is to stick out your tongue and attempt to make an S sound. This will probably look ridiculous, but it prevents your tongue to go all the way up to the roof of the mouth. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sound will be created. Once you recognize the sound, you can practice on replicating it without accidentally spitting on everyone in front of you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you can say with confidence: </span>
