<h2>Hi, I’m Till and I once studied 15 hours for a simple English test and got all three answers wrong.</h2>
<p>Habits are a great thing, if they’re useful. But we absorb the ones are harmful much easier. It’s a lot like how the tastiest food is always the kind that’s unhealthy.</p>

<p>When it comes to <a href="http://b4tea.blogspot.ba/2011/07/daily-habits-that-cause-memory-loss.html">habits which impact your language learning capabilities</a>, there are quite a few you probably don’t understand correctly. What’s worse, what you think is a good habit, might just turn out to be a bad one.</p>

<p>One example of a misguided bad habit is the belief that motivation is a critical element in any type of long-term activity. What is the substitute for motivation? Keep reading!</p>
<h1>#1 Studying without a pen in hand</h1>
<p>In any lesson, you must write down notes about the information directed at you. If you do not, you will forget the majority of what you have learned, and the process will have to be repeated.</p>

<p>By writing down what you have learned, you tie strings to the points you have learned. Once going over your notes, you can pull those strings and draw the knowledge back to you. If you do not, the knowledge just passes through your head and gets forgotten.</p>
<h1>#2 Lack of sleep</h1>
<p>If you only needed physical strength to battle the day, there would be no need for sleep. You could just lay in bed and listen to music.</p>

<p>Sleep is a critical component for absorbing knowledge. Think of the mind as a library where everything you have learned during the time before sleep is analyzed and organized. After a good sleep all books are arranged and stored in the corresponding shelf. Your mind is prepared for the day ahead. This is not only a tip for language learning but for life in general.</p>

<p>Life is easier with sufficient sleep! Surprising, right?</p>

<p>Do your best to go to bed at the same time in the evening and to wake up at the same time in the morning. This is only one of the many ways you can avoid <a href="http://fgbt.org/Health-Tips/5-bad-habits-that-damage-your-brain.html">the main habits which damage your brain</a>.</p>
<h1>#3 Drinking, smoking and a poor diet</h1>
<p>Much like the previous flaw, smoking and drinking makes life difficult in every aspect. <a href="https://steptohealth.com/11-daily-habits-damage-the-brain/">Your memory weakens if</a> you are smoking and drinking, among other defects. So to achieve optimal results, try your best to quit or stay away.</p>

<p>Nutrition is a very important component which influences memory, energy and vitality. To stay active, motivated and mentally prepared for absorbing the extensive amount of information any language has to offer, you must do your best to have a healthy diet. In short, a healthy diet is the one where your plate is full of various colours.</p>

<p>Additionally, be sure to eat your breakfast in the morning!</p>
<h1>#4 Listening to audio too advanced for you</h1>
<p>There are many audio recordings for English learning available online, but often, they are tied to a certain level of skill. You must establish what your level of knowledge is and then get adequate material.</p>

<p>People think that if you listen to something over and over again, it will stick, but that’s only the case with a popular song on a loop you try so hard to get out of your head. Don’t waste your time listening to podcasts, recordings or even lessons that are too difficult for you. You won’t remember anything which makes the effort worthless.</p>
<h1>#5 Studying like a maniac</h1>
<p>You probably got a burst of motivation at one point and said “I will learn English!” and then proceeded to study and read for hours. As useful as it may appear, this is a mistake.</p>

<p>You might hold on for a day or two, and afterwards you’ll get tired of studying. Language is one of the many cases where discipline dominates over motivation. Studying English every day for thirty minutes is far more effective than studying for five hours once a week.</p>
<h1>#6 Random learning</h1>
<p>If you’ve ever been to school — I imagine you have, given that you are reading this — you know that one general field or lesson is spread out across multiple lectures. This is because the lesson is simply too extensive to understand fully in a day’s time.</p>

<p>Establish a schedule for yourself or follow certain guidelines you can find online. Be sure to study a lesson until you understand it, no matter how tiring. If you abandon a lesson halfway through, it will be harder to come back to it later.</p>
<h1>#7 Thinking that a lack of talent is an excuse</h1>
<p>Some people have a natural mastery of languages. They can speak them with ease and see patterns where others don’t, allowing them to memorize the rules of a language easier.</p>

<p>Even though talented people do exist, talent alone cannot carry them far. Exercise and exposure to the language is a mandatory component in language learning. And the idea that you have a “lack of talent” is a poor excuse.</p>

<p><img title="" src="https://englishletics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/null-16.jpeg" alt="" width="624" height="357" /></p>

<p>Remember, language learning demands discipline. Motivation will wear out in time, and discipline ensures you stay on this long path of language learning. Set up a schedule and follow it to at least have a guideline that will keep you on track and prevent you from giving up.</p>
