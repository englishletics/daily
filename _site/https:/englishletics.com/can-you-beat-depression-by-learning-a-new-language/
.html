<h2>Hi, I’m Till and I’m a strong believer that at any point in life, you must always strive for something.</h2>
<p>When you think about language and depression, there is no clear connection that comes to mind. Learning a language is a task, not so much a relaxing session of reading, so how could it possibly help a person cope with depression?</p>

<p>There are a few ways but one of the primary reasons learning a new language helps is the activity it demands. Depression results in a person doing nothing, very frequently just laying around the house, waiting for the sadness to wear off. Learning a language is not a straining activity, but it is active enough to get the wheels turning and slowly drag the mind out of that dark place.</p>
<h1>A powerful distraction from depression</h1>
<p>Depression is a bitch. Luckily, it depends heavily on your attention and focus. Often, we get most depressed when there is a gap in our schedule or when we have too many days without much to do. At these times, depression emerges most frequently.</p>

<p>Language learning is a great method to fill these gaps. Even if you already completed your studies for the day or for the week, watching a movie in a different language requires energy and focus. It is a valuable distraction and it provides benefits for your language learning efforts.</p>
<h1>A window into a world of possibilities</h1>
<p>As many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jan/13/learning-language-depression-anxiety">people suffering from depression know</a>, depression cuts off your ability to see the bigger picture. Your options feel limited, and you don’t want to do the things which would certainly bring you joy. I could send you the most cheerful video in the world, but what’s the point if you aren’t willing to watch it?</p>

<p>Sadly, I can’t help you if you’re unwilling to do something. You just have to force yourself, sorry. But it’s good to know language is one of these positive things which are sure to help. When you’re depressed, if at all possible, try to engage in language learning.</p>

<p>The reason it’s such a positive influence is because any language learning tool or book contains different outlooks on life. Your mind has no choice but to imagine the world beyond those four dark walls. Luckily, English books don’t contain pessimistic examples so it’s an additional plus!</p>
<h1>A sense of progress and achievement</h1>
<p>Depression makes it difficult for individuals to see their own achievements, let alone celebrate them. When learning a language, there are clear indicators of how far you’ve come and how much you’ve achieved.</p>

<p>The amount of progress becomes evident within a month’s time. This makes it easy to look back and feel that you’ve made progress. That particular feeling is like holy water against depression. Language learning apps further boost this feeling with the many features they offer, such as scores for the number of lessons completed or number of words learned.</p>
<h1>Access to information, knowledge and help</h1>
<p>Let’s talk about the English language in particular. Being the global language, learning and using it even in its basic forms opens you up to an entire new world of possibilities and information.</p>

<p>The internet is teeming with places where English speakers gather and communicate. Games, chat rooms, forums, news, comment sections and more. All of this becomes available at your fingertips even if you’re barely speaking much English. Additionally, you have an easier access to helpful information such as methods to beat depression, methods to memorise a language, and other useful articles.</p>

<p>Of course, this benefit is mainly obtained once you have some grasp on the English language, but it’s certainly one to look forward to and motivate you to keep going.</p>
<h1>Fire up the brain!</h1>
<p>Exercise and information make the brain pulse with energy. It’s surprising how positive you feel once you’ve completed a task or learned a lesson. With language learning, this feeling is very frequent as there are many lessons, small and bigger to be learned and applied.</p>

<p>Once your mind is in a specific mindset, it does its best to maintain that mindset, so be sure to keep up with the discipline of learning if you want to maintain that positive feeling. Likewise, once your mindset is focused on being negative and depressed, you’ll have to struggle to break out of it and start learning again, but it will absolutely be worth it!</p>
