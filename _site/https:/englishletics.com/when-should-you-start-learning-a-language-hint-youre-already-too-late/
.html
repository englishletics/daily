<h2>Hi my name is Till and I learned Vietnamese in 4 years, without ever going to school or using a book.</h2>
<p>Learning a foreign language is best done at an early age. Surely you’ve heard this, but how early is too early? Better yet, how late is too late?</p>

<p>Relax, it’s never too late to start learning a new language. That’s why these articles and courses exist, but it is more difficult to learn it beyond a certain age. There are several different cases and claims at what moment in your life it’s best to learn.</p>

<p>Keep in mind though that you are unable to travel back in time. The best possible time to start learning a language is NOW. Every day you wait makes it more challenging, bit by bit.</p>
<h1>Should babies learn a second language?</h1>
<p>I guess you could try teaching a baby the list of irregular verbs in the English language, but it won’t be absorbed logically. Still, children should absolutely be exposed to a second language at the earliest age possible. This results in an individual growing up to be bilingual.</p>

<p>In high school, I knew people of mixed cultures and I recall it being advised that children only focus on learning one language to avoid confusion. This was very unfortunate as they missed out the chance to almost effortlessly become bilingual. Today, things are different and children are encouraged to become bilingual from an early age.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The first few months of a child’s life is when the brain is not a sponge, but a black hole. It sucks in information at an incredible rate. At six to eight months of age, this “black hole” weakens. With this in mind, it is best to expose a child to knowledge at the earliest age possible.</p>
<h1>Best age: Before 7 years of age</h1>
<p>When talking about children of such a young age learning a new language, people often say things like:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Let children enjoy their childhood!</li>
 	<li>Teaching them another language will confuse them!</li>
 	<li>It can’t be done, it just makes it confusing and difficult!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2009/05/learning-second-language-good-childhood-mind-medicine">But all of these statements are false</a>. The sooner a child starts learning a second language, the better. The benefits of a child learning a second language at such a young age include better focus, attention and cognitive function.</p>

<p>Naturally, when talking about such a task, it is not advised to chain a child to the task of learning a new language by the book. Instead, it is advised for parents to do some sweating and hard work to expose their child to the language in a playful and interesting way. This refers to the child spending time in an environment where that language is spoken, or teaching them through interaction, fun and games.</p>
<h1>Acceptable age: 12 and up</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.brainscape.com/blog/2015/06/when-should-you-start-learning-second-language/">The mind is like a sponge</a>. Well, a very complicated sponge, shaped like a house with windows. At first, these windows are open and they allow absorption of raw knowledge, behavioural patterns and the foundations of thinking. Human beings are defined by this period in their life. After the age of 12, it is presumed that these windows close and the architecture of the mind is complete.</p>

<p>Once the mind has a solid foundation set and one language dominating over it, it absorbs information in a different way. Instead of simply absorbing it, a child around 12 years of age is capable of understanding a language in a logical way. This is why it is often recommended for children to start learning a second language at this age.</p>
<h1>Is it too late for you?</h1>
<p><img title="" src="https://englishletics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/null-13.jpeg" alt="" width="624" height="416" /></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Simply put. It is not. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/13/am-i-too-old-to-learn-a-language">But, it becomes more and more difficult with age</a>. You see, a child’s brain is a very flexible one. As we presented it, it is a sponge which absorbs knowledge. As time moves on, it becomes more and more sophisticated, absorbing information based on logic and established patterns.</p>

<p>However, with time, the brain loses its capabilities to adapt and absorb information. The brain is a fascinating thing about which despite every research we still know very little about, but we do know that the brain adapts if you allow it. The brain decays, but mental activity slows down this process. Learning, mind exercises, crossword puzzles slow down its degradation. In a similar way, learning a new language at an old age can do the same.</p>

<p>Granted, it will be challenging at an older age, but it is most certainly a process that can benefit your mind and body if you dedicate yourself to it. Check out this video, I promise it will lift your spirit, regardless of how old you are.</p>
