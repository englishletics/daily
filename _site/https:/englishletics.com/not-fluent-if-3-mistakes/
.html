<h2>Hi. My name is Till and my friend’s bad English almost got me beat up.</h2>
<p>A younger friend of mine was working on a paper for her English class which would greatly influence her final grade, and she asked me to look over the draft to check for any typos she might have overlooked. Two paragraphs into the text, I immediately knew she was about to fail.</p>

<p>Sure, one typo can’t be that big of a deal, right? But there are some mistakes you DO NOT want to make when writing an official paper, let alone dare call yourself a fluent speaker.</p>

<p>Now, you’re probably asking yourself what this dreaded mistake was. Well, it will be discussed in detail among these 3 elementary rules of the English language you should know. Specifically, her mistake was committed when she broke rule #3.</p>
<h1>Rule #1: Idioms</h1>
<p>Let’s start with a mild rule that isn’t too demanding. Idioms are unique to each language, and they indicate that you are familiar with the way that specific language is used outside of the textbook, IRL.</p>

<p><b>What exactly are idioms? </b></p>

<p>An idiom is a phrase or an expression that has a figurative, or sometimes literal, meaning. Let’s take a look at an example of an idiom in the English language:</p>

<p><i>“If you’re not sure how to talk to your crush, just say hi and<b> play it by ear!”</b></i></p>

<p>Now, if you were to literally understand this sentence, then it makes no sense whatsoever. The original use of this phrase referred to playing music without a music sheet. So, one would play music from memory or by improvising as they went along, trying to make it sound good.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smart-words.org/quotes-sayings/idioms-meaning.html">There are plenty of other idioms in the English language</a>, and the best way to learn them is to either go through lists and explore their meaning, or to be in the presence of native speakers.</p>

<p>Here are some of the most commonly used idioms. Do you have a clue what they mean?</p>
<ol>
 	<li>A hot potato.</li>
 	<li>Actions speak louder than words.</li>
 	<li>At the drop of a hat.</li>
 	<li>Add insult to injury.</li>
 	<li>Barking up the wrong tree.</li>
</ol>
<p>One interesting thing is the fact that the origins of idioms have slowly been lost over time. People don’t pay attention to the real meaning behind idioms, and if you were to ask a native speaker exactly why “to play it by ear” means to improvise, they would probably be unsure.</p>

<p>Idioms are so frequently used without hesitation, that people know what they mean, but are uncertain why. Ironically, this ignorance about the real meaning of idioms defines a native speaker because they use so many idioms so often they don’t have the need to consider the meaning.</p>
<h1>Rule #2: Double negatives</h1>
<p>Languages are confusing. In the Serbian language, for example, double negatives are acceptable and considered to be correct. In English, this is not the case.</p>

<p>“I did not eat nothing” is a very accurate sentence in some languages. But if you literally translate the double negative, it makes zero sense in English.</p>

<p>In case you slept during math class, here’s how positives and negatives work.</p>

<p>Positive + Positive = Positive</p>

<p>Positive + Negative = Negative</p>

<p>Negative + Negative = Positive</p>

<p>So, in a sentence that says “I didn’t do nothing,” we have a double negative, which equals to a positive. If we ignore the fact that this sentence is completely inaccurate and pretend it actually has grammatical value, “I didn’t do nothing” means “I did something.”</p>

<p>This is one of the most common mistakes non-native speakers make because they try to literally translate sentences from their own language into English.</p>
<h1>#3 They’re/Their/There and similar examples</h1>
<p>This is only one of the many cases of several worlds in the English language sounding identical, but not being spelled the same. This is a dead giveaway that you are not mastering the language as well as you might think, but ironically enough it is not exclusive to foreign speakers.</p>

<p>Native speakers make this mistake very often simply because they’re lazy. Especially since people like to substitute “you” for the more informal form “u.”</p>

<p><img title="" src="https://englishletics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/null-1.jpeg" alt="" width="624" height="416" /></p>

<p>Let’s quickly run over the meanings of these terms to show you how you can memorize them once and for all.</p>

<p><b>They’re </b>= They are. An apostrophe in the middle of a word implies there is something missing. In this case, the letter “a” was omitted to allow two words to be merged, because fluent speakers save 0.00001 milliseconds by mashing these two words into one. How edgy.</p>

<p><b>Their </b>is a possessive<b> </b>pronoun which means something belongs to someone. I don’t have any witty remarks about this one, you’ll just have to know it.</p>

<p><b>There </b>implies a location. You can easily remember it because <b>where </b>and <b>there </b>look similar.</p>

<p>Other common mistakes of this type include</p>
<ul>
 	<li>You’re/Your</li>
 	<li>Were/We’re/Where</li>
 	<li>It’s/Its</li>
</ul>
<p>To wrap up the story from the beginning, my friend used the inappropriate form of “there” when she wrote something along the lines of “<b>Their</b> it was!” to which I wanted to eat the paper because she is very keen on bragging about how her English is flawless.</p>

<p>P.S. If you’re still curious about how my friend got me into trouble with her bad English, it was when she misunderstood a salesman in Spain and attempted to pay 16 Euros for something that costed 60 and leave.</p>
