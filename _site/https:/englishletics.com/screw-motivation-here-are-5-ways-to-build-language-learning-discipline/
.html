<p>Motivation is a great tool for short term tasks. Sadly, language learning is not one of them. Learning a language takes a long time and your motivation will most certainly wear off before you get to learn enough.</p>

<p>Discipline, on the other hand, is a long term tool which ensures your mind doesn’t question whether or not it wants to do a certain activity. It simply becomes used to doing it, which makes it very easy for you to keep going. However, it differs from motivation in that it is not triggered, but learned. You have to maintain discipline if you want to reap the benefits it offers, and here are five ways how.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1>#1 Maintain the momentum</h1>
<p>Let’s assume you built a schedule for yourself. Most of us do this before doing the actual work. It’s usually at those times when we’re full of energy, but in the end we end up postponing the scheduled timeslot because we’re too lazy or simply tired.</p>

<p>The main reason people stop following the schedule they set is because at one point they say “I’ll just skip one day.” Do this only if you absolutely must, but never do it out of sheer laziness. If you’re not feeling too willing to study once, do it at least for 10 minutes to maintain some part of the momentum you’re trying to build.</p>

<p>If you fail to maintain the momentum of learning, it will crumble and fall and it will be that much more difficult to get back on track.</p>
<h1>#2 Get out of the procrastination loop</h1>
<p>“I’ll do it later!” or “I’ll do it but only after …”</p>

<p>Sounds familiar? Procrastination is a vicious little thing because you’re not only lying to the people around you, you are lying to yourself. You’ll probably convince yourself how there are more important things in the world for you to do than to study. Especially when it comes to learning something you at one point voluntarily decided you would study.</p>

<p>Discipline begins to form the moment you exit the procrastination loop, but how do you do it? There are many tips and tricks online about procrastination, and here’s one of them. Do something only for a short amount of time. No matter how lazy you feel about learning, tell yourself “I’ll do it for only 10 minutes.”</p>

<p>The trick is that only 10 minutes doesn’t sound bad, especially if it’s something that takes years to learn. Sounds great, right? But the second part to the trick is that you’ll step out of the procrastination loop and you’ll think more clearly the moment you sit down to learn.</p>
<h1>#3 Provoke motivation</h1>
<p>Regardless of how strict of a person, every single one of us has encountered lack of willpower to do something, no matter how important. When discipline is at play, you will try your best to get on with the activity, but even then, you might feel like you just can’t bring yourself to do it.</p>

<p>At such times, discipline and motivation meet each other to help you. Learn what triggers your motivation to a specific activity and use it. Thinking about the end result or the benefits obtained from learning consistently can be quite motivating.</p>

<p>If that isn’t enough, try a more raw approach.</p>

<p>Look up a song that motivates and energizes you to do anything you set your mind to. Note, however, that this isn’t a constant fix. If you use a song too frequently, it tends to lose its power, thus this is a temporary fix for those tough situations. This is the best possible way to use motivation: in short doses and occasionally. The majority of the time, discipline should reign.</p>
<h1>#4 Set smart deadlines and goals</h1>
<p>“Learn English by the end of the year” is a very pointless goal to follow. It is too general, not to mention distant. This can be your general goal, but when it comes to disciplinary learning, set multiple smaller goals and tie them to specific deadlines.</p>

<p>Baby steps work quite well with something as vague and elevated as learning a new language. If you were to attempt to just cram forward and learn as much as you can within a year, you’ll find yourself quickly exhausted and frustrated.</p>

<p>Set daily, weekly and monthly deadlines and goals you want to reach. It should be something achievable and within reason. For instance, “Learn the list of irregular verbs by the end of the month” is a good example. “Become fluent in a year” is a bad one.</p>
<h1>#5 Assign a physical place to study</h1>
<p>A room in your house or apartment should be designated to your studying area. Not only is this practical, but you will also be more willing to learn once you enter this area.</p>

<p>In a way, you are programming your brain to think and know what to do at the very moment it enters this area. You’re programming your brain to want to learn language at that point.</p>

<p>If you want a similar example of how this brain programming works, you don’t have to go further than your bathroom. Even as you approach it, your brain knows what is about to happen and your attention is drawn to the current state of your bodily functions.</p>

<p>Think of discipline as the gas which maintains the flame, and motivation as the spark that ignites it.</p>

<p>Discipline is a very useful ally in every aspect of life, not just language learning. If you start to apply it in this specific field, it can easily spread to other parts of your life and bring you further benefits, but it has to be maintained. Upon reading this, I’m certain you’d agree that the benefits are certainly worth the effort.</p>
