<h1>5 Dumb Ways Native English Speakers Suck At English</h1>
<p>Native or foreigner?</p>

<p>In most cases, native speakers are far better at English as they speak it faster and they had a massive head start in learning it. There is no argument here. However, there are certain ways in which native speakers suck at English.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When it comes to communication in particular, native speakers tend to use slang, are lazy to adapt, have no empathy or the will to understand your side and lack accurate knowledge about the structure of the English language.</p>

<p>Okay, let me back this up, so people don’t think I’m insulting native speakers.</p>
<h1>#1 Slang over knowledge</h1>
<p>Slang is a tricky thing. Often, you know when you are using slang, but some phrases or sentences have become so rooted in common language that people don’t realize they are using slang. Abbreviations and idioms are similar, and a native speaker might unleash an arsenal of those on you without even realizing it.</p>

<p>When native speakers unintentionally use slang while speaking to foreigners, the problem becomes even bigger when foreigners take the meaning literally and act as if they understand. For example, if I were to tell you in English “In a nutshell, I am lazy,” you might think that eating nuts makes me lazy, which makes no sense!</p>

<p>If you encounter bizarre statements from native speakers, be sure to interrupt and confirm you got the meaning right. The “nutshell” example was a basic one that most likely nobody would fall for, but <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20161028-native-english-speakers-are-the-worlds-worst-communicators">mistakes of this kind can truly cause huge misunderstandings, even going so far to cause financial loss</a>!</p>
<h1>#2 Too lazy to adapt</h1>
<p>Many native speakers must be overjoyed because English is so widely used, but sadly they are happy because it eliminates their need to learn a second language. They don’t feel they have to adapt to you as a foreigner because typically you’re the one approaching them first.</p>

<p>Some will have understanding, most commonly those who have learned a second language or are bilingual. They’ll understand that you need the most direct method of communication, without any hidden meanings behind words.</p>

<p>Those who only speak English though are a bit different. It is often not by intention but they simply don’t have a grasp of what it feels like to try to communicate in another language.</p>
<h1>#3 Lack of interest and empathy</h1>
<p>Native English speakers who do not speak a second language don’t have an idea of what it feels like to not know a language fully. Even though they are the ones who don’t know any other language than their own, but everything evolves around theirs. This is why some might treat you like you are mentally disabled, whilst others talk to you like a buddy who understands everything they say.</p>

<p>Both of these situations are annoying and make communication challenging. An additional problem emerges when foreigners try their best to avoid a conflict and simply nod and agree even though they don’t understand fully what is being said. If you do not understand something, interrupt the speaker and ask. Sometimes, culture stands in the way of this, though.</p>
<h1>#4 Lack of correct knowledge</h1>
<p>The English, or any language you learn in school for that matter, is the “correct” version of the language. As we said, slang and idioms make it difficult for you to understand a native speaker, but the reverse is possible as well.</p>

<p>You will learn the proper way to construct sentences and phrases in the English language, using grammar the correct way, but this might result in a native speaker not understanding you. Although speech comes more naturally to them, your sentences will be more correct. This is why foreign speakers can often communicate in English amongst themselves a lot easier than with a native speaker.</p>

<p>Native speakers may assume you are “on their level” so to speak, and they’ll assume you might put hidden meanings in the sentences you say to them.</p>
<h1>#5 An empty vocabulary</h1>
<p>Native English speakers who do not focus on learning their language sometimes only absorb words they are exposed to and words they use on a daily basis. Foreigners, on the other hand, go through a large number of examples, exposing them to words they “might” use at one point.</p>

<p><img title="" src="https://englishletics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/null-4.jpeg" alt="" width="624" height="416" /></p>

<p>This can at times result in foreigners using rarely used words because they found them in a dictionary or Google translate. Granted, this is the fault of the foreigner, if they choose the overly complex form of a word, but the native speaker should be able to understand that word since he’s the one who should be dominating the language.</p>

<p>The vocabulary grows as you read books. You learn phrases and words used in different context. This applies to all speakers, both native and foreign, and it is a mandatory method to extend your vocabulary: read!</p>
