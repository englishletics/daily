## Conversation

> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=1.84 stop=7.23 %} Person 1 (female): __Listen, I want to clear up a few things with you right away. You know what I mean, right?__     
> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=7.23 stop=8.08 %} Person 2 (Male): __Of course.__     
> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=8.08 stop=21.72 %} P1: __After finding out about this, I realized that I need to talk to you straight away, but I didn’t have the courage. We’ve known each other for a long time. I’ve always thought a lot about you. Oh god, I don’t know how to tell you this...__  
> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=21.72 stop=30.83 %} P2: __Come on, don’t be shy. Actually, you don’t need to tell me this, we don’t need words anymore. You are my true friend, only a true friend, nothing more.__  
> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=30.83 stop=42.24 %} P1: __Really? What an idiot I am. I thought you felt an interest for me. I thought there was more between us than just a simple friendship. Is it because tennis is the only passion in your life?__  
> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=42.24 stop=47.21 %} P2: __Sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you. The truth is that there is someone else in my heart.__  
> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=47.21 stop=53.38 %} P1: __Oh. Ok, it’s better the true reason for your refusal was because of another woman, and not tennis.__    
> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=53.38 stop=55.51 %} P2: __I think of you more than sports, you know.__  
> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=55.51 stop=60.96 %} P1: __Don’t worry. Let’s pretend none of this happened. Let bygones be bygones. Ok?__    
> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=60.96 stop=63.30 %} P2: __Of course, and no hard feelings.__   
> {% include play.html identifier="examples1" start=63.30 stop=65.31 %} P1: __Sure. See you in a bit.__
