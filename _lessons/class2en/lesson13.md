__When I think about things, I try not to think too much about the negative side of them. I try to focus on the positive. I think things will work out for the best, and they usually do. Some of my friends are just the opposite, they always keeping complaining and I tell them that I don't wanna hang out with them unless they get more positive. I guess I prefer to be around people who also focus more on the positive. But I get that not everyone is the same. Some people are introverted and others are extroverted. Some people are sensitive and others are thick-skinned.__
