## Conversation

> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=2.05 stop=5.74 %}Person 1: __I am so under the weather, I have no idea what I'm going to do.__   
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=5.75 stop=7.18 %}Person 2: __Why? What happened?__    
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=7.18 stop=11.80 %}P1: __My daughter Anna doesn't want to go to preschool. She says she's scared.__    
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=11.80 stop=18.61 %}P2: __Oh I know exactly how you feel. My son Jamie burst into tears the first time I left him at preschool.__  
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=18.61 stop=21.87 %}P1: __Really? I thought I was the only parent with that problem.__  
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=21.87 stop=26.35 %}P2: __Oh trust me, you're not alone. Just keep your chin up and be patient.__  
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=26.35 stop=32.57 %}P1: __But how do I make her like preschool? As soon as I mention it, she starts crying and I feel like I'm breaking her heart.__  
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=32.57 stop=40.94 %}P2: __Talk to her about it and tell her to look on the bright side. She's afraid of the unknown. She'll enjoy herself when she gets used to preschool.__  
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=40.94 stop=49.43 %}P1: __Hmm, I'll try. I get carried away with trying to make her feel happy, I forget about the bigger picture. Preschool will teach her and prepare her for life.__  
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=49.43 stop=54.25 %}P2: __Absolutely! Tell her to be strong and get ahold of herself. She's a big girl!__  
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=54.25 stop=58.15 %}P1: __I will do that. Thank you for helping me look on the bright side.__  
> {% include play.html identifier="conversation" start=58.15 stop=63.03 %}P2: __You're welcome. Let me know how it goes, and remember that I'm always here for you.__
