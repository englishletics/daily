## Describe someone's appearance 
{% include play.html identifier="monologue" start=3.88 stop=45.70 %}

**Let me introduce my ex-boyfriend. He is Daniel. He is a quite handsome man. He is in his mid–twenties, but he looks young for his age. He is of medium height and well–built. He has a square face with brown eyes, a straight nose and full lips. He has short black wavy hair. He looks even more attractive with his glasses. I've always thought he bears a striking resemblance to someone on TV. He cut himself climbing a tree when he was ten and he's got a scar just below his ear. Oh, I wish he were here. I miss him so much.**
