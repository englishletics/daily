## Conversation

> Person 1: **What do you think of Andy?**          
> Person 2: **In what sense? As a man or as a tennis player**       
> P1: **Do you have to ask? As a man, of course**       
> P2: **I’ve just met him. So I can’t really say**       
> P1: **In my opinion, I think he is just great**     
> P2: **Oooh, what’s this am I hearing? You might be in love**     
> P1: **Yes, it is the first time I’ve fallen head over      heels in love. So much in love… but he doesn’t even notice me. We share so many common interests and we see things in the same way, we can talk for hours. But that’s it. He just looks on me as a good friend, nothing less, nothing more**     
> P2: **Have u asked him how he feels about you?**     
> P1: **No, of course not, he is not interested in      relationship now. He just cares about his career**     
> P2: **I think u should tell him. Who knows? He might be in love with u, too**     
> P1: **It’s not easy to say certain things. You know what’s it like. Put yourself in my shoes and...**     
> P2: **You might lose him forever**     
> P1: **Maybe you’re right. Maybe I have to think of a special way to show him just how I feel**     
> P2: **I’ve just had a brilliant idea. You should cook lunch for him. You write a small note which says “I like u” and u surprise him by hiding it in a napkin**     
> P1: **What a romantic idea! Do u think it will work?**     
> P2: **I think it will go straight to his heart**
