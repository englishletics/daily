## Conversation

> Person 1: **What do you think of Andy?**     
> Person 2: **In what sense? As a man or as a tennis player**  
> P1: **a**  
> P2: **a**  


Jessica: = person 1      
Robin: = person 2     
Jessica:Do you really have to ask, as a man of course     
Robin: I’ve just met him. So I can’t really say     
Jessica:In my opinion, I think he is just great     
Robin: Oooh, what’s this am I hearing? You might be in love     
Jessica: Yes, it is the first time I’ve fallen head over      heels in love. So much in love… but he doesn’t even notice me. We share so many common interests and we see things in the same way, we can talk for hours. But that’s it. He just looks on me as a good friend, nothing less, nothing more     
Robin: Have u asked him how he feels about u?     
Jessica:No, of course not, he is not interested in      relationship now. He just cares about his career
Robin: I think u should tell him. Who knows? He might be in love with u, too     
Jessica: It’s not easy to say certain things. You know what’s it like. Put yourself in my shoes and …     
Robin: You might lose him forever     
Jessica: Maybe you’re right. Maybe I have to think of a special way to show him just how I feel      
Robin: I’ve just had a brilliant idea. You should cook lunch for him. You write a small note which says “I like u” and u surprise him by hiding it in a napkin      
Jessica:What a romantic idea! Do u think it will work?     
Robin: I think It will go straight to his heart
