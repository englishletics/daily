## Conversation

> Person 1: **I like this restaurant, especially its decoration style.**   
> Person 2: **I like the seating arrangements.**    
> P1: **So do I. And the music is good. It’s not too loud. I hate restaurants with loud, noisy music. This place feels really relaxed.**    
> P2: **But it’s too bad it’s so far from the city.**  
> P1: **I agree. It takes too long to get here. Hey, the menu looks really good. It makes my mouth water just looking at it.**  
> P2: **Where do we start? Some of the dishes look nice.**  
> P1: **I heard people say the restaurant is well-known for their seafood.**    
> P2: **Really? I see they have shrimp and octopus.**  
> P1: **I’ve never tried that. But I think they need to hire more people.**  
> P2: **I agree. The servers are really busy. They need one or two more.**  
> P1: **And the waitress is not really friendly. She ignored me 5 minutes earlier. That’s not good.**    
> P2: **She doesn't speak English very well.**  
> P1: **Yeah—she couldn’t answer many questions.** 


> P2: **Wow! Our bill is only $24.**  
> P1: **That’s very cheap.**    
> P2: **There is no service charge. I think we should leave a tip.**
