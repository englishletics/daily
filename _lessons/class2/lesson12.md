**I’m the type of person who tries to avoid dramas. I also have a good sense of humor. That's why I have a lot of friends and we have a lot of fun together. My girlfriend is just the opposite. She is a quite helpful person. That's definitely the reason why I love her. She always helps people without expecting anything in return. But I guess she prefers staying at home and being on her own. Listening to her voice can make all of my stresses and pressure melt away.**
