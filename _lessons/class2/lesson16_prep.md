## Conversation

> Person 1: **Listen, I want to clear up a few things with you right away. You know what I mean, right?**   
> Person 2: **Of course.**   
> P1: **After finding out about this, I realized that I need to talk to you straight away, but I didn’t have the courage. We’ve known each other for a long time. I’ve always thought a lot about you. Oh god, I don’t know how to tell you this...**  
> P2: **Come on, don’t be shy. Actually, you don’t need to tell me this, we don’t need words anymore. You are my true friend, only a true friend, nothing more**  
> P1: **Really? What an idiot I am. I thought you felt an interest for me. I thought there was more between us than just a simple friendship. Is it because tennis is the only passion in your life?**  
> P2: **Sorry. I didn’t mean to upset you. The truth is that there is someone else in my heart.**
> P1: **Oh. Ok, it’s better the true reason for your refusal was because of another woman, and not football.**  
> P2: **I think of you more than sports, you know.**
> P1: **Don’t worry. Let’s pretend none of this happened. Let bygones be bygones. Ok?**  
> P2: **Of course, and no hard feelings.**
> P1: **Sure. See you in a bit.**
