# Greeting somebody

In German you can greet someone in many ways. Normally it depends on where come from. A Bavarian will greet someone differently than some from Hamburg or Berlin. Here we will cover generic greetings and then location-specific ones.

Let's start with the generic greetings that you can use everywhere.

> Guten Tag!

or

> Ich grüße Sie!
> Seien Sie gegrüßt!

or just

> Hallo!

Depending on the time of the day you have different greetings, like that:

> Guten morgen!  
> Guten Tag!  
> Guten Abend!  

Let's assume you are in Bayern, Hessen, or Baden-Württemberg. Everyone will greet you with:

> Grüß Gott!  
> Servus!  

In the north of Germany people will say this:

> Moin!  
> Moin Moin!  

On the more informal side, people use these:

> Hi!  
> Na du?  
> Hey!   
> Ahoi!
