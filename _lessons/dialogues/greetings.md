# Greeting somebody

In German you can greet someone in many ways. Normally it depends on where come from. A Bavarian will greet someone differently than some from Hamburg or Berlin. Here we will cover generic greetings and then location-specific ones.

Let's start with the generic greetings that you can use everywhere.

> Guten Tag!

or

> Ich grüße Sie! *(I greet you)*  
> Seien Sie gegrüßt! *(Be greeted)*  

or just

> Hallo! *(Hello)*

Depending on the time of the day you have different greetings, like that:

> Guten morgen!  *(Good morning)*  
> Guten Tag!  *(Good day)*  
> Guten Abend!  *(Good evening)*  

Let's assume you are in Bayern, Hessen, or Baden-Württemberg. Everyone will greet you with:

> Grüß Gott!  *(Greet god)*  
> Servus!  *(something like: I be at your service)*  

In the north of Germany people will say this:

> Moin!  *(Something like: good morning, good day, and good everning)*  
> Moin Moin!  *(Something like: good morning, good day, and good everning)*    

On the more informal side, people use these:

> Hi!  *(Same as English: Hi)*  
> Na du?  *(Like: hey, how are you?)*  
> Hey!   *(From English: Hey)*  
> Ahoi!  *(Sailors use this)*
