Some methods of learning have been around for quite some time. One hilarious example is putting the book under your pillow in hopes of learning its contents while you sleep. Sure, it’s funny now, but it wasn’t always like that.

Likewise, there are quite a few learning <a href="https://www.mezzoguild.com/19-dont-dos-learning-a-language/">methods today which certainly work, but are very ineffective</a>. Some of them can make your learning twice as difficult to say the least.

One example is the belief that by simply shoving as many words into your head as possible, you’ll learn the language. Yes, yes you will, but it will take you a lot longer than if you were to follow a specific lesson plan.

With that example out of the way, let’s check out five more!
<h1>#1 Learning grammar first</h1>
We are all different when it comes to learning anything. Some of us will think that the most comfortable way to learn a new language would be to immerse ourselves in it and spend time near people who speak it. Others prefer the more literal approach of learning.

Some learners think it would be a smart idea to learn the grammar of a language, and only then proceed to learn meanings behind words. Don’t be fooled by thinking your brain works like a construction site. You can’t expect grammar to act as a literal foundation: once it’s learned, you just shove things on top of it and you have a lovely structure.

That’s not how the brain works! Grammar is extremely difficult to learn because there are always exceptions to the rules, and you need examples. They won’t do much good when you don’t know what they mean. Learn basic grammar only if you like, but there’s no point in trying to memorize everything before learning a good deal of vocabulary with it.
<h1>#2 Only listening to the language</h1>
Have you ever tried learning while you sleep? Putting on headphones with the information you want to learn being played in a loop. I’d advise against trying this because not only does it not work, you probably won’t sleep too well with someone constantly whispering into your ear.

Listening to the language is highly effective when combined with other methods. Repeating what you have heard helps your brain remember the information easier. Repetition works, but only if you’re the one repeating what you’re trying to learn.
<h1>#3 Lack of structured learning</h1>
You have to follow some form of structure when you’re learning anything new, be it English or geometry. Based on your skill level, you can find an appropriate lesson plan online, or if you’re studying from a book be sure to learn in an appropriate order.

People often skip things that seem too difficult and go for what sounds easier. There is a reason for a specific order of a book written by an expert. Often, it’s because earlier lessons are required to better understand the ones coming up later in the book.
<h1>#4 Waiting to be ready before speaking</h1>
Don’t be afraid to make a fool of yourself. If a native looks at you as if you were a dumb person because of how badly you speak English, take pride that at least you are the one trying to speak a second, third or maybe even fourth language while he sticks to the only one he knows. Speak English whenever you are able to do so.

Many foreign English speakers are afraid of speaking because they think their skills aren’t perfect yet. Well, how else will you learn? Try your best to communicate, expect corrections and embrace them.

This might sound lazy but if you throw nouns at native speakers, they’ll often arrange them for you in order to check if they understood what you’re trying to say. This requires more work on their part than yours, but it’s very beneficial to you. Of course, it can be tiring but you should try your best to learn from the feedback they provide.

Don’t be afraid to speak!
<h1>#5 Sticking with a bad teacher</h1>
This mistake is the result of trust. Your teacher can clearly see if his or her method of teaching is working and if you are advancing. You can’t because you don’t understand the language as well as they do. Now, the question is whether a teacher will tell you you’re not advancing as well as you should.

Try to assess the situation yourself and see if you are making progress within a month’s time. There are also some primary signs of a bad teacher you should look out for. Things like lack of interaction with the student, not allowing you to repeat and practice your knowledge etc.

Do a self-check every now and then to see if you are making progress. There should be a clear sign of improvement within at least a month. If you are relying on various methods for learning and you find you aren’t improving that much, be sure to review them and adjust to new ways of learning.
