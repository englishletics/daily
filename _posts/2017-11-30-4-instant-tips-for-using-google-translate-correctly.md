<h2>Hi, my name is Till and I only use Google Translate to check spelling.</h2>
Google Translate has been around since 2007. It is nothing today like what it was in the beginning. It has advanced so much that you can translate paragraphs with extreme accuracy even if they contain mild slang.

Still, despite its astonishing power to bridge languages, people still use it incorrectly. What’s worse, they take Google Translate as a fully accurate tool and simply copy the translation into official documents they are writing.

Today, we stop the madness! Here are 4 crucial tips for using Google Translate correctly. It really is a simple tool if you keep these tips in mind.
<h1>Tip #1: Don’t use it!</h1>
Okay, I don’t mean don’t use it at all, but if you are working on an essay, a paper for class or something similar, <b>DO NOT </b>use Google Translate for longer sentences or paragraphs. You can and should most definitely use it to translate individual words which you can look up further and confirm as correct. There might be several translations for one word. Make sure you get the right one.

When translating sentences, there is a very high chance you will get it wrong, and by wrong I don’t mean accidentally swallow a pronoun. If you mess up on Google Translate you run the risk of writing nonsense. <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/translation-fails/">Here’s an example of what nonsense looks like</a>.
<h1>Tip #2: When translating sentences, anticipate mistakes</h1>
Try not to use complex tenses when translating. If you want to translate a full sentence, make it as simple as possible. Better yet, break down sentences into smaller ones to ensure accuracy. If you extend a sentence, Google Translate may take it literally and translate it.

Syntax is difficult to translate because unique rules exist in every language. Sometimes, Google Translate gets it right, but most of the times it doesn’t. To double check if something went wrong in your translation, you can swap the sentence into retranslate and see if the English version of your sentence gets translated back and looks identical or at least mostly similar to the one you entered.
<h1>Tip #3: Explore further meanings</h1>
When translating words, which is the most accurate way to use Google Translate, be sure to check for further meanings. “To spin” and “To circle” are two different things but their meanings are similar when taken out of context. Be sure to check for additional meanings and find the one that fits the word you selected. <img title="" src="https://englishletics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/null-1.png" alt="" width="624" height="380" />

To confirm if the translation of a word is correct, add some simple context and see if Google Translate uses that word.

For example, to test what “to spin” means, you can ask Google Translate to process the sentence “<i>He decided to spin the bottle.” </i>
<h1>Tip #4: Don’t use slang!</h1>
As said, Google Translate has evolved greatly and can recognize some of the commonly used phrases. Still, it is best to avoid slang in Google Translate altogether because if the software hasn’t “heard” of it, it will translate it incorrectly.

When attempting to translate slang or phrases into another language, you can pull the slang apart and enter its literal meaning before translating. Thus, you are translating the core of the slang, not slang itself.

Other than directly explaining it, there is no valid reason to use a language’s slang when attempting to speak in English. Thus, I think I speak for all native and fluent English speakers when I say you will be forgiven for not using a witty slang statement in your response.

Remember, only use Google Translate as a check-up tool. You can use it for communication but in a very informal fashion. It is good enough to copy paste text around if you only want to grasp the general meaning of something. For instance, you can at least grasp the basic gist of a sentence in a different language, but in no way is this tool going to help you learn a language.

In fact, Google Translate might even make learning a language more difficult if you insist on memorizing inaccurate sentences. It is great for learning and checking word meanings before you proceed to study those meanings and applications in more detail.
