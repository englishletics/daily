<h2>Hi, I’m Till and I once talked to someone on Skype for 11 hours.</h2>
People want to help but they often suck at it. Here’s a piece of advice for you: the next time someone gives you advice, ask them to elaborate and name several points as to why you should listen to them.

My advice to you is to be wary with other people’s advice, and here are five points why you should listen to me.
<h1>#1 Move to a different country and you’ll learn!</h1>
Great advice, but it’s not as blunt as you may think. When someone tells you to move to a different country, they are actually advising you dive into the language and build connections with people who speak the language you are trying to learn.

Let’s say you move to the UK. If you don’t go out much and only interact with the person at the cash register or the post office, you’re not gonna learn much. It all depends on your personality. We are all different, and some of us don’t like to hang out in coffee shops or interact with new people. Most people do! They enjoy talking and hanging out, but there’s no point in moving if you’re not going to do the interaction.

If you’re not a very social person, you’ll probably benefit a lot more by trying to find friends online who speak English. Still, if you moved to the UK or a different country, try to go out and interact. It can only do you good! Just don’t walk in dark alleys.
<h1>#2 Just push yourself to learn!</h1>
Learning English, or any other language for that matter, takes time. It’s not a pop quiz! You can’t just force yourself to sit down for three hours and study, eagerly anticipating that moment when you can shut the book and say “bye! I’m out.”

Learning a language takes a lot of time, certainly more than an hour, a day, a week or a month. Nobody has that kind of stubbornness to just keep doing it. Actually, I’m pretty sure if you do something by force for years, you are not the brightest person in the world.
<blockquote>I hated every minute of training, but I said, 'Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.

Anyway, pushing yourself whilst hating what you’re doing doesn’t work because such motivation is temporary. It’s much like exercising. Most of us hate it, and until we learn to love it, we’ll keep quitting. Rest days to allow your brain to store the new information is just as important as the time spent learning.
<h1>#3 Ignore grammar!</h1>
This tip is very useful when first learning a language, but a problem emerges when people take this tip to the extreme. Listen, there’s nothing wrong with wanting to learn a language just enough to be able to communicate with the locals, but grammar is something that should not be ignored in the long run.

Slang and the way the locals talk is very unique to each region and can only be learned through experience. With that in mind, grammar is what shapes and defines the massive amount of words and sentences you’ve learned.

Essentially, ignore grammar at the early stages of learning but once you have enough language skills for basic communication, take grammar very very seriously.
<h1>#4 You don’t need books! Just get an app</h1>
Apps are great for beginners, but do not expect to become fluent. They are a good starting point to shove as many words into your head as possible. Sure, they sometimes cover grammar, but rarely do they go so deep that you understand it fully.
<h1>#5 Any book will do! Just learn!</h1>
Surprisingly, languages change and inaccurate information about any language, English in particular, is still very much available. This is why there are many revised editions of books. Yeah, it’s not only just for the money.

Additionally, when it comes to useless advice, you’ll want to choose books which will help you learn with ease. If any book will do, why not just grab a dictionary? A lot of fun in that one, specifically under the F section.
