<h1>4 Simple Signs You Picked The Wrong Language Teacher</h1>
<h2>Hi, my name is Till and once I corrected my native English teacher in class.</h2>
Your English teacher is there to do a lot more than simply show you how a certain word is pronounced or tell you what to memorize. The worst part is that so many teachers teach the wrong way! And what’s worse, you think they’re guiding you on the right path and you expect positive results after a while.

Let’s take a look at some clear signs you should look for a different teacher.
<h1>#1 Highlighting false information</h1>
One of the most common errors we do as human beings is looking at false information and repeating it. If you make a mistake in class, the worst thing a teacher could do is repeat that mistake back to you.

Why?

When something is repeated, it gets remembered. If you hear an incorrect sentence being spoken over and over again, your mind will remember it. Languages are all about memorizing vast amounts of information which means you sometimes won’t be able to quickly distinguish accurate from inaccurate information.

Sure, with practice you can remember the correct form of a verb or the right sentence structure, but it becomes difficult when your instinct makes a choice based on memory rather than logic.
<h1>#2 Lack of practice</h1>
When it comes to language, a book is merely a tool which can aid the teacher to give a lesson. Practice makes perfect, and conducting conversations and exercises is the best way to learn a language.

If a teacher throws a bunch of lessons at you and tells you to write down pages upon pages of tenses for you to memorize, it can be overwhelming. And, if we are honest, you don’t need a teacher to memorize stuff at home.

Language lessons should mainly consist of examples and speech. This is why a good English teacher will attempt to speak English throughout the entire lesson, starting from the very beginning.
<h1>#3 Anecdotes over matter</h1>
This particular one is not only useless but utterly annoying. Some teachers have a tendency to talk about their lives because they have a crowd of people in front of them, listening to every word they say.

Now, I don’t know where this comes from. I am not a psychologist, but something about a room full of listeners gives people the idea they get to talk about anything they want. This is why you may have had a teacher in school who talked about his or her life during every lesson. In my case, I had a maths teacher who regularly used half of her lesson to talk about her life.

When it comes to English, examples are used in lessons and many opportunities arise for people to think of a story or anecdote they could share. This isn’t bad in language classes if the teacher uses his or her past to show how proper words are pronounced. But often, teachers tend to completely ignore the lesson and continue to babble on about their life.

Regardless how fun and interesting their anecdotes might be, this is not what you came here for, and you do not want to waste time or money on a lesson if you’re not learning anything.
<h1>#4 Lack of interaction</h1>
Each and every language requires you to practice. It isn’t sufficient only to go through examples though. You should not only listen, but also speak the language as much as you can if you hope to absorb it.

The best type of teacher is the one who provides examples of sentences and grammar rules and demands that you apply them yourself. The worst kind is the one who goes over examples himself in attempts to “show you” how it’s pronounced and used. This is less effective than you speaking the examples yourself.

When exercising speech, pronunciation and grammar rules, it helps to hear your own voice and apply the knowledge immediately. If your teacher reads everything for you and expects you to learn by watching, you might as well go to YouTube for free to learn the language.

P.S. The mistake my native English teacher made which I corrected in class was when she said <i>“If you have any questions, you can ask Brad and I.”</i> Can you spot the mistake?
