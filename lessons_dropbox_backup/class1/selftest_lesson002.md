## {% include play.html testvar=100 %} #1 What are we going to eat for dinner?

Chúng ta sẽ ăn gì cho buổi tối. 
Be going to ý nghĩa là “sẽ". Ví dụ:

 - **{% include play.html %}What are we going to eat for breakfast?** (*Chúng ta sẽ ăn gì cho buổi sáng?*)
 - **{% include play.html %}What are we going to eat for lunch?** (*Chúng ta sẽ ăn gì cho buổi trưa?*)
 - **{% include play.html %}What are you going to eat tonight?** (*Bạn sẽ ăn gì cho buổi tối.*)

## #2 I’m going to fix some pork chops.
Tôi sẽ nấu lại vãi miếng thịt heo.
Be goingto: ý nghĩa là “sẽ". Ví dụ:

 - I’m going to go to Japan - VNVN
 - I’m going to talk to her - VNVN
 - He is going to get married. - VNVN

Fix  ý nghĩa sửa. Nhưng ở đây ý nghĩa “nấu ăn".
